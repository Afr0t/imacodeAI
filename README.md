## Description
📝 UI Code Generator with Deep Learning is an AI-powered web application that automatically generates UI code from user interface (UI) images.
The system utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze the images and produce the corresponding code, significantly accelerating the UI development process.

## Key Features
- 🔑 **Image Upload**: Users can upload UI images representing various formats (web, mobile, etc.).
- 🔑 **Code Generation**: The trained AI model generates the source code corresponding to the uploaded image, saving developers time in the development process.
- 🔑 **Multi-Language Support**: The system supports a range of programming languages commonly used in UI development, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and more.
- 🔑 **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers an intuitive user interface for easy image uploading, language selection, and retrieval of the generated code.
